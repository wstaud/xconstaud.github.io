# Personal Site

## A site I built, mostly from the ground up, to showcase my work.

### About: 
I built this website with the purpose of demonstrating my front end work. While there is/will be plenty of back end material in here... the focus is on the front end. The designs are built by myself in Photoshop/Illustrator and coded using minimal external tools. 

### Tools used:
- Simple Grid
- Jquery
